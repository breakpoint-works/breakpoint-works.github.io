**Naval Architect** specializing in **CFD**, **VPP**, and **optimization** for high-performance sailing yachts. Experienced in developing **advanced computational tools**, **machine learning models**, and **hydrodynamic designs** tailored to competitive yacht racing. Passionate about leveraging technology to enhance yacht performance and push the limits of innovation.

Although I was born and completed my **Bachelor’s and MSc in Naval Architecture** in *Madrid*, my passion for the sea was forged elsewhere. Growing up, I spent long seasons in the *Canary Islands*, where my family's origins lie. It was there that my love for **sailing**, **watersports**, and especially **windsurfing** took hold — shaping not only my personal passions but also the professional path I would follow.

Since 2018, I have worked closely with [**Juan Kouyoumdjian**](https://www.juanyachtdesign.com/) on some of the most ambitious projects in the world of **yacht racing**. This experience placed me at the heart of the **high-tech sailing scene**, collaborating with leading figures across the yachting industry.

Beyond yacht racing, I have expanded my expertise to other fields, including **wind-assisted ship propulsion (WASP)** and motorsport, particularly **Gran Turismo racing**. I am always driven by a spirit of adventure and a relentless pursuit of new challenges — whether at sea, on land, or through the next great engineering challenge.
