*Performance Prediction, Hydrodynamic Optimization*

<!--more-->


Involved in optimizing the **hydrodynamic performance** of the **modern 6 Metre yacht _Stella_**.

The work focused on:
* **CFD-based** refinement of the **keel and fin shapes**.
* **VPP analysis** to assess the performance.

The objective was to extract competitive advantages through **appendage optimization** while complying with class rules.

Main tools: **CFD (Star-CCM+), VPP, and Python**.
