*Concept Sizing, Foil Design, Flight Control, Performance Analysis*

<!--more-->

Confidential 40ft **foiling monohull** project developed for a **private owner** with the goal of delivering an **America’s Cup–level sailing experience** combined with enhanced **safety standards** for regular use.

I was involved as part of the [Juan Yacht Design Team](https://www.juanyachtdesign.com/) team from the **preliminary concept phase** through to the **on-water development** and **post-launch improvements**.

This ambitious project brought together **some of the top experts in the industry**, tackling unique challenges in high-speed monohull design:

1. **Concept sizing** to strike a balance between **performance and safety**, avoiding extremes in size or speed.
2. **Performance prediction**, including **dynamic simulations** to evaluate behavior and safety during critical maneuvers.
3. **Foil and rudder design**, carefully constrained by **cavitation limits**.
4. **Flight control system development**, including a **custom simulator** to test and refine the control logic and software.
5. **Collaboration with sail and mast designers** to ensure coherence between aerodynamics and flight dynamics.

After launch, I supported **Flight Control commissioning** and conducted **performance analysis** during early sailing trials.

Later iterations have focused on **refining appendage design** to further increase top speed following several successful seasons on the water.

Main tools: **CFD (Star-CCM+), VPP, Python**, and custom-built **simulators**.
