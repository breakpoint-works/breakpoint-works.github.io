*Performance Prediction, Foil Design*

<!--more-->

A milestone project both personally and professionally, as I joined **Juan Yacht Design** at the start of the **ClubSwan 36** design process.

The design brief was clear: create a **fun, high-performance one-design boat**, free from the constraints of rating rules and focused on **pure sailing enjoyment**.

My role included:
* **Performance prediction** from early concept stages through final refinement.
* Design and optimization of the **innovative C-Foil appendage**.

Main tools: **CFD, VPP, and in-house Python tools** for performance evaluation.
