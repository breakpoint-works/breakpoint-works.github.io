*CFD Simulations*

<!--more-->


**Aerodynamic analysis** of Manu Urcera's **Mustang M1** in Argentinaâ€™s **Turismo Carretera (TC) Championship**.

**CFD simulations** of the full car, including its **cooling system**, with the goal of optimizing **aerodynamic performance** and creating a detailed **aero map** to support the team in setting up the car for different race conditions.

Main tools: **CFD (Star-CCM+) and Python** for simulation and post-processing.
