*Concept Design, Performance Prediction, Appendage & Sail Development*

<!--more-->

Involved from the very beginning in the development of the **ClubSwan 43**, a yacht designed as the perfect intersection of **cruiser**, **one-design racer**, and **ORC competitor**.

Key contributions included:
*	**Conceptual studies** to assess the impact of **ORC rules** and optimize performance within rating constraints.
*	Support during the transition from a rule-optimized design toward a more **one-design oriented platform**.
*	Extensive **performance prediction** work and input into **sail development**.
*	Contribution to the design of **keel and rudder** to achieve the desired balance between rating optimization and real-world handling.

Main tools: **CFD, VPP, and Python** for performance analysis and optimization.
