*Conceptual Design, Performance Prediction, Appendage Design, Boat developement*

<!--more-->

Involved as part of the **Juan Yacht Design** team from the **preliminary design phase** of the **ClubSwan 80 My Song**. The project began with a **concept selection contest** between different designers and boat configurations.

Later, I participated throughout the **entire design process**, with a special focus on **performance prediction**, **appendage design**, and achieving the right **hydro-aero balance** for the boat.

There was close collaboration with **sail designers** to support **sail development**.

Following launch, I was involved in **refinement loops** to optimize key parameters such as **keel geometry**, **bulb weight**, and **water ballast**, enhancing overall performance.

Main tools: **CFD (Star-CCM+), VPP, and Python** for simulation and data analysis.
