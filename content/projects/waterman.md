*Foil Design*

<!--more-->

Design of a **hydrofoil** for **WATERMAN CO**, aimed at a versatile setup suitable for **wing foil**, **downwind**, and **pumping**.

The final design featured a **high aspect ratio main wing** with **thin optimized foil sections** distributed along the span. Special emphasis was placed on **pitch stability and dynamic balance**, leading to an integrated development of the **main wing, fuselage, and stabilizer** as a complete package.

Main tools: **Potential flow codes** for design and performance evaluation.
