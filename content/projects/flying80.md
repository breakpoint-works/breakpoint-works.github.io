*Conceptual Design, Foil Design, Flight Control, Performance Analysis*

<!--more-->

**Foiling monohull** developed as a **record-breaking concept**, aiming to push the limits of offshore monohull performance.

As part of the **Juan Yacht Design** team, I contributed during the **preliminary design phase**, focusing on **performance prediction**, **appendage design**, and **weather routing** to analyze the statistics of key offshore sailing records.
