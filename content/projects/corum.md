*Foil Design, Performance Prediction, Boat and Sail Development*

<!--more-->

Involved as part of [Juan Yacht Design Team](https://www.juanyachtdesign.com/) in the design of the **IMOCA 60 CORUM L’Épargne**, built for **Nicolas Troussel’s** campaign in the **2020 Vendée Globe** and later raced in the **Ocean Race Europe 2021**.

I contributed to both the **initial concept** and **development phases** of the boat.

*	Early work focused on:
	*	**CFD** and **VPP simulations** to validate the overall design.
	*	Strong focus on **foil design**, where **FSI** simulations were used the refinement of the appendage.
	*	**Weather Routing** to validate the overall design as well as obtaining relevant wind statistics.
*	In later stages, I worked on the **evolution of foil geometries**, **performance data analysis**, and collaborated closely with **sail designers** to align sail development with the yacht’s performance profile.

Main tools: **CFD (Star-CCM+), FEA (Abaqus) for FSI, VPP, In-house router, and Python** for simulation and data analysis.
