*Foil Design, Performance Prediction, Boat developmet*

<!--more-->

Involved as part of [Juan Yacht Design Team](https://www.juanyachtdesign.com/) in the design of an **IMOCA 60** built for **Sebastien Simon’s** campaign in the **2020 Vendée Globe**.

I contributed to the project during both the **conceptual design** and **development phases**.

*	Early work focused on **CFD** and **VPP simulations** to validate the overall yacht concept, with special emphasis on **foil design**.
*	Later stages involved refining different **foil versions** and analyzing **performance data** to correlate with simulations and enhance real-world performance.

Main tools: **CFD (Star-CCM+), VPP, and Python** for simulation and data analysis.
