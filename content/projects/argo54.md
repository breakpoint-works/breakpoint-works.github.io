*Performance Prediction, Balance Analysis*

<!--more-->

Involved as part of the [Juan Yacht Design Team](https://www.juanyachtdesign.com/) in the development of a **54m sailing superyacht**.

The goal was not to chase ultimate performance, but to ensure **balanced and enjoyable sailing characteristics**â€”a challenge at this scale.

Analysis focused on:
* **Performance prediction (VPP)** to support the design of **sails, rudder, and keel**.
* Special emphasis on achieving **good helm balance** and **smooth sailing response** under various conditions.

Main tools: **VPP** and **Python** for simulation and analysis.
