*Performance Prediction, Weather Routing, Economical Evaluation*

<!--more-->

Confidential project involving the evaluation of multiple **WASP technologies**.

The scope included:

* Predicting **performance** and estimating **fuel and emission reductions** across candidate systems.
* Conducting **weather routing** under varying objectives (e.g., max speed, fuel savings).
* Assessing **regulatory impact**, particularly regarding the **Carbon Intensity Index (CII)**.
* Developing a detailed **economic model**, including full **cash flow simulations** over the vesselâ€™s operational life.


Main tools: **CFD (Star-CCM+)**, **Python**, and custom **economic analysis frameworks**.
