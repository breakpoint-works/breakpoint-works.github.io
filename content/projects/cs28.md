*Performance Prediction, Appendage Design*

<!--more-->

Involved as part of the **Juan Yacht Design** team in the development of the **ClubSwan 28**, conceived as an **entry-level model** for the ClubSwan line.

The design brief focused on offering **pure sailing fun** under **one-design racing rules**, with strong emphasis on responsiveness and ease of handling.

My role included:
* **Performance prediction** to refine the sailing characteristics.
* **Appendage design** to balance agility, control, and performance across varied conditions.

Main tools: **VPP, CFD (Star-CCM+), Python** for simulation and design optimization.
