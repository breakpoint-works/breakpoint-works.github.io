*Performance Prediction, Sail Developement, Performance Analysis*

<!--more-->

Part of the **Juan Yacht Design** team during the final design and early sailing phases of the **ClubSwan 125 Skorpios**.

I joined the project during the late design stages, focusing on **performance prediction** using **VPP** tools. I also conducted **CFD-FSI simulations** on the **canting keel trim tab**, contributing to the refinement of the appendage.

Once launched, I worked on the **calibration and analysis of sailing performance**, correlating real-world data with simulation results.

Additionally, I collaborated with **sail designers**, supporting **sail development** with VPP-based performance insights.

Main tools: **CFD (Star-CCM+) coupled with FEA (Abaqus), VPP, and Python** for simulation and data analysis.
